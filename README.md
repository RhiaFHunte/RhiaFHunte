# 👋🏾 Hi, I’m Rhia – Aspiring Front-End Developer

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm currently exploring the world of web development while transitioning from a background in digital content and eCommerce. I'm passionate about creating user-friendly, engaging web experiences and excited to keep building on my skills as I grow in this field.

## 🌱 Learning & Development

I've been learning JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and React in my spare time through self-study using platforms like Codecademy and YouTube. I'm also getting comfortable with tools like VS Code, Git, and GitHub. Right now, I’m focused on improving my front-end skills and starting to learn more about back-end development.

## 💡 Background and Skills

I come from a content and eCommerce background, which gives me a good sense of how people interact with websites and what makes digital experiences work well. I'm organised, curious, and love solving problems, and I’m keen to continue my learning journey.

## 🤝🏾 Let’s Connect!

I'm open to beginner-friendly projects, pair programming, or just connecting with others who are also learning or switching into tech.

📫 You can find me on LinkedIn at [Rhia Hamilton](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rhiahunte/) if you’d like to connect or collaborate.

Thanks for stopping by! I'm excited to keep learning, keep building, and be part of the tech community. 💻✨
